** 2.2.1 - Programming Fundamentals
*** Basic constructs
    Three basic constructs:
        Sequence
        Selection
        Iteration
            Loops
                Count controlled
                    For loops
                        Repeat code inside them a fixed number of times
                        i.e: ~for k = 1 to 100~
                Condition Controlled
                    Do Until loops
                        Keeps going _until_ a condition is met.
                        i.e: ~do ... until true~
                    While loops
                        Keep going _while_ the condition is met.
                        i.e: ~while true~
** 2.2.2 - Data types
    Data Types
        Integer (int)
            Whole numbers only
        Real/float (real)
            Numbers that have a decimal part
        Boolean (bool)
            True/false
        Character (char)
            A single letter, number or symbol
        String (string)
            A string of text
    Casting
        Casting is used to change the data type of a variable to another
        Normally done using functions that begin with the target data type's name
            i.e: ~int(), real(), str(), etc.~
