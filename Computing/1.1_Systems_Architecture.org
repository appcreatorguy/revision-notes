#+TITLE: 1.1 Systems Architecture

* 1.1.1 - The architecture of the CPU
** Purpose
The CPU is the *Central Processing Unit*
It's the brain of the computer system _(Somewhat)_
Processes all instructions and data
** Components
*Control Unit* (CU)
	Overall control
	Manages *Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle*
	Controls flow of data in the CPU
*Arithmetic Logic Unit* (ALU)
	Handles all mathmetical calculations
	Addition, Subtraction, Binary shifts, Bitwise (Boolean) operators
*Cache*
	*Very fast* memory in CPU
	_Slower_ than *registers*, _Faster_ than *RAM*
	Store regularly used data so it can be accessed quickly by the CPU
	Low *Capacity*
	Expensive compared to RAM
	3 *Levels*
		_L1_ - quickest, lowest capacity
		_L2_ - slower, holds more
		_L2_ - slowest, holds the most
*Registers / Von Neumann Architecture*
	Temporary stores of data
	Extremely fast
	*Examples*
		Program Counter *(PC)*
		Memory Address Register *(MAR)*
		Memory Data Register *(MDR)*
		Accumulator
** Fetch-Execute Cycle
*Fetch*
	Copy memory address from PC to MAR
	Copy instruction stored in MAR address to MDR
	Increment PC
*Decode*
	Instruction in MDR is decoded by CU to binary
*Execute*
	Instruction is then performed
	_Examples_
		LDA - Load data from memory
		STA - Store data in memory
		ADD, AND, etc. - Performs mathmetical or logic operations using the ALU
		JMP - Changes the address in PC
		HLT - Halts program
* 1.1.2 - CPU performance
** Characteristics can affect a CPU's performance
*Clock Speed*
	The number of instructions a processor core can carry out per _second_
	Measured in _Hertz_ (Hz)
	The higher the clock speed, the greater the no. of instructions the CPU can carry out, the faster the CPU
*Number of Cores*
	Each core in a CPU can perform independently of the rest
	The more cores a CPU has, the _more instructions_ it can carry out at once, so the faster it can process
	Most PCs and phones have at least 4 cores
*Cache Size*
	A _larger_ CPU Cache gives the cpu faster access to _more data_ it needs frequently.
* 1.1.3 - Embedded Systems
Embedded Systems are **built into other devices**
Examples
	Dishwashers
	Microwaves
	TVs
*Dedicated* systems
	Efficient
	Easier to design
	Cheap
Often used as _control_ systems
    Monitor and control machinery
        i.e: Dishwasher - control water pumps, temperature, dishwasher cycles
