<a id="org329626d"></a>

## 1.2.1 - Primary Storage (Memory)

Refers to the *memory* areas that a *CPU* can access very quickly.
It has the **fastest** *read/write* speed and is mostly **volatile**


## 1.2.2 - Secondary Storage

**Non-volatile**. Where all data (operating systems, applications, user files) are stored when not in use.
Includes:

-   Magnetic hard disk drives
-   Solid state drives
-   CDs and SD cards

Much **slower** *read/write* speeds compared to [Primary Storage.](#org329626d)


## 1.2.3 - Units

Computers use 1s and 0s to represent the flow of electricity, with a **1** is used to show that electricity is flowing, and a **0** shows that it is **not** flowing.
    This is called **binary** code.
    Each 1 or 0 in a binary code is called a **bit** (binary digit). For example, `1010` is 4 bits.

*Using powers of 2 (i.e: 1024 bytes in kB, etc.) would also be acceptable*
