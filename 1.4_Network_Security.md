# 1.4.1 - Threats to computer systems and networks


<a id="orgc5f5b88"></a>

## Forms of Attack

Network **Attacks** Come in different forms.
For example:

-   **Passive Attacks**, where someone monitors data that travels across a network and intercepts data packets on the chance that it may contain sensitive information.
    -   They may use *network-monitoring* hardware and software such as *packet sniffers*.
    -   This makes them *hard to detect* as the hacker is quietly listening. The best defence is **data encryption**
-   **Active Attacks**, where someone attacks a network with [Malware](#orga085344) or other planned attacks.
    -   These are more easily detected, and the main defence is a **firewall**
-   <a id="orga40d74b"></a> **Insider Attacks**, where someone within an organisation exploits their access to steal information.
-   **Brute Force Attacks**, where an attacker *actively* tries to gain information by cracking security through *trial and error*.
    -   They use automated software to produce hundreds of likely combinations on the chance that one is correct.
    -   The best defence for these attacks are simple measures such as **locking accounts after too many failed attempts** and **stronger passwords**
-   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks**, where a hacker tries to prevent users from accessing a network or website by flooding it with useless traffic, making it **extremely slow or inaccessible**.

## Malware

1.  **Malware (Malicious Software)** is installed on someones device, typically without their permission.
2.  Typical actions that malware take include:
    1.  **Deleting** or modifying files
    2.  **Sacreware**, where the user is scared into paying the malware creators for the computer to be uninfected.
    3.  **Locking Files**, such as *ransomware*
    4.  **Spyware**
    5.  **Rootkits**, which *alter user permissions* and give hackers administrator access.
    6.  Opening **Back-doors**, or holes in someones security.
3.  Malware can **access** your device in different ways
    1.  **Viruses** attach themselves to certain files, such as programs, so that when the file is run, they are activated.
    2.  **Worms** are like viruses, but **self-replicate**, meaning that they can spread very quickly.
    3.  **Trojans** are malware **designed as legitimate software**. They do not replicate themselves, instead relying on **unsuspecting users to install them**.

## Social engineering

Social engineering is the way of **gaining sensitive information by influencing people**. A common form relies on a **telephone scam call**, where people **pretend to be an administrator**, and persuade people to **disclose personal information**, such as *login details*.
Another type is **Phishing**, where **scam emails or texts** are sent, claiming to be from **a reputable company**, attempting to trick people into **disclosing sensitive info**, such as *bank details*. They are often **sent to thousands** of people, in the hope that someone will fall prey. To combat this, many email programs have **anti-phishing** features.

## SQL injection

Networks make use of databases, which are queried using **SQL**. **Injections** are **pieces of SQL** typed into a **website&rsquo;s input box**, causing a **malicious SQL query** to be carried out, such as all login information being outputted. If a websites SQL code is **insecure**, it can be **an easy way** for hackers to get past a firewall.

# 1.4.2 - Identifying and preventing vulnerabilities.

Common prevention methods include:

-   **Penetration Testing**, where **specialists simulate attacks** on a network to **identify weaknesses** before they are exploited.
-   **Physical Security**, where the **physical elements of a network are protected** from damage, both intentional and unintentional. This can be done through **Locks, pass codes and surveillance**
-   **Passwords**, to prevent **unauthorised users** gaining access.
-   **User access levels**, to **limit the number of people with access** to sensitive information, preventing [Insider Attacks](#orga40d74b) on the network.
-   **Anti-malware software**, to **find and stop malware** from damaging a network and its devices.
-   **Firewalls**, to **block unauthorised devices** from gaining access.
-   **Encryption**, to **protect data** travelling **over a network** securely.
